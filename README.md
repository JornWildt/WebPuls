# WebPuls

WebPuls is an animated HTML5 website that displays activity from external sources as colored pulsing circles. The idea
is that every external event should result in a blinking circle on the screen where the color and size indicates the
type of event that occured.

The project is heavily inspired by "Listen to Wikipedia" (http://listen.hatnote.com/ and https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia).

The website is integrated with some internal stuff at cBrain which I cannot include. It does unfortunately result in some
irrelevant web.config settings that should simply be removed in other projects.
