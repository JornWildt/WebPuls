# WebPuls

WebPuls is an animated HTML5 website that displays activity from external sources as colored pulsing circles. The idea
is that every external event should result in a blinking circle on the screen where the color and size indicates the
type of event that occured.

The project is heavily inspired by "Listen to Wikipedia" (http://listen.hatnote.com/ and https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia).

WebPuls uses SignalR for distributing event information and the Raphael JavaScript library for HTML5 graphics.

## Using WebPuls

1. Compile the project.

2. Setup your webserver to point to the WebPuls.Host folder (.NET 4.5)

3. Open the website root path in your browser (default MVC controller+method is Home+Index).

4. You should get a black screen with some dark red circles appearing after a few seconds. These circles are
   only for demo purpose and are generated by a timer in Globals.cs - remove them when your stuff works as expected.

5. Link the "WebPuls" project to your own project (NOT the WebPuls.Host project).

6. Call WebPuls.PulsConnection.AddBlimp() to add a new circle.

Thats it. Have fun.
